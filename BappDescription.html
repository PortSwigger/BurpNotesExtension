<p>This extension adds a new tab to Burp's UI, for taking notes and organizing external files that are created during penetration
testing. You can create text documents and spreadsheets directly within Burp, 
and send HTTP requests and responses directly to new or existing files.</p>
<p>Within the Notes tab, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Save Notes: Save any currently open documents to a file.</li>
    <li>Load Notes: Load a previously saved set of notes from a file.</li>
    <li>New Text: Add a tab with a new text document.</li>
    <li>Import Text: Load the contents of a text document.</li>
    <li>New Spreadsheet: Add a tab with a new spreadsheet.</li>
    <li>Import Spreadsheet: Load the contents of a CSV document.</li>
    <li>You can also export individual notes tabs to an external file.</li>
</ul>

<p>From anywhere within Burp, you can use the context menu to send selected 
items directly to the Notes tab,
to either a new or existing document.</p>
